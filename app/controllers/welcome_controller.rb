    # within folder: /app/views/welcome
    # it defaults to `.html` because the default `format` for requests in
    # rubyonrails is always HTML unless you specify otherwise (like json..
    # http://localhost:3000/index.html or .json)
    # erb: is the default built-in templating system with Rails
    # By default Rails will use `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` as
    # the layout, so the content of `home.html.erb` will be inserted in the
    # place of `<%= yield %>` within the layout
    # render :home

    # the default behaviour is to render: index.html.erb within folder:
    # /app/views/welcome for each action  🖕 action's name.html.erb
