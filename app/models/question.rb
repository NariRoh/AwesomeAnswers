class Question < ApplicationRecord

  # this sets up one-to-many association between the question and the answer
  # in this case a question has many answers (note that to set a one-to-many
  # association you will have to pluralize `answer` - Rails convention)
  # we will have many handy method to helps us query associated records.
  # for instance we can do:
  # q = Question.last
  # answers = q.answers
  # the line above will fetch all the answers associated with question: q
  # we do this because Rails doesn't know if you want one to one or one to many
  # It's highly recommended that you add the `dependent` option to the
  # association which tells Rails what to do when you delete a question that
  # has answers associated with it, the most popular options are:
  # destroy: which will delete all associated answers before deleting the
  #          question
  # nullify: which will update all the `question_id` fields on the associated
  #          answers to be come `NULL` before deleting the question
  has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy

  # validates :title,  presence: true
  # validates is rails method
  # validates(:title, { presence: true })
  # You can add your own message
  # validates :title, { presence: { message: 'must be given!' } }
  validates(:title, { presence: { message: 'must be given!' },

  # when use `valitates` with an `s` then Rails expect one of the Rails built-in
  # validation options such as: :presense, :uniqueness, :numericality..etc

  # if you want to write a custom validation method then you will need to use
  # `validate` (no s)
  # custom validation method
