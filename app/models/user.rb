class User < ApplicationRecord
  # has_secure_password does a few things for us:
# - it automatically adds `password` and `password_confirmation` attribute
#   like you do attr_accessor :abc in some class. These will be in memory but
#   won't be saved(will be gone! as other info saved) as you don't have fields
#   for them also, it won't create new fields in the user database
# - it automatically adds a presence validator on the password
# - it automatically adds a confirmation validator if you add a
#   password confirmation field
# - when password is provided `has_secure_password` will generate a salt and
#   will generate a digest of the password + salt and it will store it in the
#   `password_digest` field
# - it gives us a handy method called `authentciate` that will help us check
#   if the password is correct
