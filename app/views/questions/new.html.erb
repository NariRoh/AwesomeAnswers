<h1>New Question</h1>

<%# form_for is a Rails helper (built-in) generate a form to create or updated_at
    a record in the database through a controller. `form_for` expects to be
    given an ActiveRecord object as its first argument. If the object is not
    persisted then the form will use POST request and the URL will be the create
    action path which is this case `questions_path` (not persisted means not saved
    in the database) q.persisted? %>
<%# form_for doesn't care where to send your form as long as it's given the path
    so? routes.rb get '/blahblasas' => 'home#index', as: :questions <- this path
    We also have access to the `f` object which eases creating fields for the
    form. The field will be automatically pre-populated with any data set in the
    object (such as title / body). It will also automatically set special `name`
    attributes to the generated fields. %>
<%# <input name='abc' (input is 123) => {'abc'} => '123' %>
<%# <input name='hi[abc]'> => {'hi' => {'abc' => '123'}} %>
<%# { title: "what is 0.2 + 0.1", body: "hard question" } this looks the same as
    q = Question.create({ title: "what is 0.2 + 0.1", body: "hard question" })%>
<%= form_for @question do |f| %>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :body %>
    <%= f.text_field :body %>
  </div>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
